        <h1>Using Models for Log Differencing</h1>
        <p class="lead"><br> Much work has been published on extracting various kinds of models from logs
		that document the execution of running systems.  In many cases, however, for
		example in the context of evolution or testing, engineers are interested not
		only in a single log but in a set of several logs, each of which originated from
		a different set of runs of the system at hand.  Then, the difference between the
		logs is the main target of interest.
		
		In this paper we investigate the use of models for log differencing.  Rather
		than comparing the logs themselves, we generate a concise model that describes
		and highlights their differences.  Specifically, we present nKDiff, a sound and
		complete extension of the classic k-Tails algorithm, from one log to multiple
		logs, where the behaviors that are common to all logs and the behaviors found in
		only some logs are differentiated.
		
		We have implemented nKDiff, validated it, and evaluated its performance on
		mutated logs that we have generated based on publicly available models from the
		literature.  Finally, we have made nKDiff available in a prototype
		web-application, for experimenting.</p>
