        <h1>Using Models for Log Differencing</h1>
        <p class="lead"><br> Much work has been published on extracting various kinds of models from logs
		that document the execution of running systems.  In many cases, however, for
		example in the context of evolution or testing, engineers are interested not
		only in a single log but in a set of several logs, each of which originated from
		a different set of runs of the system at hand.  Then, the difference between the
		logs is the main target of interest.<br><br>

		In our paper "Using Finite-State Models for Log Differencing", we investigate the use of finite-state models for log
		differencing.  Rather than comparing the logs directly, we generate concise
		models that describe and highlight their differences.  Specifically, we present
		two approaches based on the classic k-Tails algorithm.
		First, 2KDiff, which computes and highlights simple paths containing sequences
		of k events that belong to one log but not the other. Second, nKDiff, which
		extends the classic k-Tails algorithm from one log to multiple logs, and
		distinguishes the sequences of length k that are common to all logs from the
		ones found in only some of them, all on top of a single model.  Both approaches
		are sound and complete modulo the abstraction defined by the use of k-Tails.<br><br>

		We have implemented both approaches and evaluated their performance on
		mutated logs that we have generated based on publicly available models from the
		literature.  we have also conducted a user study including 60 participants
		demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in log differencing tasks. 
		This experimental web-tool was used by the participants. <br><br>
		
		You are welcome to explore the tool yourself!<br>
